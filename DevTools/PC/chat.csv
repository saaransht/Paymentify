Dear pre-final year students,

*Greetings from Placement Committee 2023-24*

Based on the performance of the applicants for the role of Placement Coordinator, we are disappointed to say that most branches have only 1 or 2 or even 0 candidates contesting for the role considering a significant number have withdrawn their candidature.

This lax attitude among the pre-final year students is disturbing. Please remember that the position of placement coordinator is one of the highest responsibilities that a student can take up in his/her career.

Your batch's future with regards to campus placements depends heavily on your placement coordinators.

Hence, we are reopening the application process for new applicants.

Interested students can register at the link given below.  You must note that this process will be continuous and comprehensive in order to match with the progress of the current PC interns.

You might face difficulties during the placement season if none of the candidates from your branch qualifies to become PC and a PC from a different branch is assigned to take care of yours."

1) Off-campus internships (Both offline and work from home) can come under SIRE only if the company has verified your work through a certificate.

*Note:* Certificates will be verified by CDC at the time of submission.

2) For dual degree students you can go for summer internship in an industry but you *must* have the authority of your supervisor and see that your research internship topic must be in line with your main project topic.

3) Training courses from online platforms such as Udemy will not be entertained under SIRE.

4) Research work conducted under NITR professors can also qualify for inclusion under SIRE, provided the professor certifies your work. However, it's important to consider this as the last option.

5) It's advisable to select a professor other than your assigned RP professor. Even if the professor is same, the project topic should differ.

6) You can also do a SIRE project under a professor from a different department than your own.

7) Those who haven’t bagged an on-campus internship must do any internship/training for atleast 8  weeks. Those who have bagged an on-campus research internship also need to do 8 weeks training. If anyone is not getting training for a period of 8 weeks, they can do 2 trainings for a duration of 4 weeks each."

*Instructions*
1. Students can choose upto a maximum of 2 domains (Analog/Digital/Embedded Software)  of their choice (Internship/full time) while registering for the test.
2. Test consists of technical and Aptitude sections. Depending on the number of domains that a student chooses while registering for the test, their test paper gets triggered by the system. For example, if a student chooses both Analog and digital, then he/she has to give Aptitude (30 Minutes)         + Analog Paper (45 Minutes) + Digital paper (45 Minutes) making the total test time of 120 minutes. Both the technical domain sections are in the same paper. They don’t have to login separately. On one login they will be able to give both the domain tests. If a student chooses only one domain - Analog, then the total test time would be Aptitude (30 Minutes) + Analog Paper (45 . minutes) making the total test time as 75 minutes.

6. During the assessment or from the time the test has started, ensure that you do not open any link or new tab or new window or click on 	any Pop-up. As this would lead to disqualification and you will be auto-logged out of the assessment.

7. ⁠Make sure you appear for the assessment in your respective slot only.

8. ⁠ACHNET is an AI based assessment portal, meaning that every moment during the test is tracked to maintain integrity and fairness.
